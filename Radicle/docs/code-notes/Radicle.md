# Radicle code notes

## src/schema/form_links.cpp:visit_link_offsets

Record-aware classification precedes generic signature-only handling for the current copy work.

## src/schema/form_links.cpp:visit_coed_formids

`COED` is classified before the structured-slot table: owner at offset 0 always, offset 4 only when the owner record in the plugin being remapped is `NPC_`. Faction ranks are never FormIDs. Strict remap fails closed when owner type cannot be determined and the union dword is nonzero.

## src/schema/form_links.cpp:visit_coed_formids

Owner and union dwords are read before `fn(0)` because `remap_raw` rewrites offset 0 into the destination encoding; typing must use the pre-remap bytes with the old context.

## src/forms/placed_reference_copy.cpp:copy_info_as_new

The contained copy validates its ancestry on a working copy before committing changes.
