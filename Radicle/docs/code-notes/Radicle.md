# Radicle code notes

## src/schema/form_links.cpp:visit_link_offsets

Record-aware classification precedes generic signature-only handling for the current copy work.

## src/schema/form_links.cpp:visit_coed_formids

`COED` is classified before the structured-slot table: owner at offset 0 always, offset 4 only when the owner record in the plugin being remapped is `NPC_`. Faction ranks are never FormIDs. Strict remap fails closed when owner type cannot be determined and the union dword is nonzero.

## src/schema/form_links.cpp:visit_coed_formids

Owner and union dwords are read before `fn(0)` because `remap_raw` rewrites offset 0 into the destination encoding; typing must use the pre-remap bytes with the old context.

## src/schema/vmad.cpp:inspect_quest_vmad

QUST extras after the primary scripts: bind byte, fragment count, optional fragment script, then fragments `{u16 Stage, u16 unused, i32 StageIndex, u8, wstring, wstring}`, then alias extras `{object, i16 version, i16 objFormat, scripts}`. Object format 2 stores unused u16, alias i16, FormID. Rewrite patches alias i16 (format 2 only) and Stage u16. StageIndex bytes are preserved.

## src/forms/quest_vmad.cpp:sync_quest_vmad_stages

xEdit FO4/TES5 name the fragment i32 `Quest Stage Index`; Mutagen `QuestScriptFragment.StageIndex`; UESP VMAD names that slot `logentry`. xEdit PERK uses a separate `Fragment Index` for chronological fragment numbers; QUST chronological ids live in `FragmentName` (`Fragment_N`). Stage u16 is xEdit `Quest Stage` / UESP `fragment.index` = QUST INDX. StageIndex is not range-checked against QSDT count. INDX remap is identity, else a unique stage-body match excluding INDX; array position is never identity. Format-1 alias objects fail closed on rewrite.

## src/forms/quest_alias_edit.cpp:write_quest_aliases

Whole-array replace copies the plugin, rewrites VMAD alias object IDs against the planned alias set, then splices aliases. Duplicate/malformed/trailing/unsupported VMAD throws before commit.

## src/forms/quest_stages.cpp:write_quest_stages

Whole-array replace remaps fragment Stage by INDX identity or unique body match, then splices. StageIndex and unrelated VMAD bytes stay identical.

## src/forms/placed_reference_copy.cpp:copy_info_as_new

The contained copy validates its ancestry on a working copy before committing changes.

## form_links.cpp :: visit_link_offsets (WTHR)

WTHR reuses FormID signatures for floats (VNAM/WNAM), bitfields (NAM1), opaque LNAM, color/speed arrays, and mixed SNAM/UNAM payloads. Remap only proven FormLink slots from WTHR_FORMID_SLOTS.md before the global signature table; otherwise float 1.0 (0x3F800000) becomes master index 63.

## src/graph/check_errors.cpp:check_load_order

Whole-load-order "Check for Errors" (#359, xEdit parity). Findings come only from slots Radicle can already prove: `collect_form_links` hits, the generated FormLink field/list target tables, `schema::preflight_plugin`, and the leveled-list graph. Unknown subrecords are never scanned, so a clean result means "no proven problem", not "no problem".

- `invalid_master_index` (warning): the raw index byte is past the MAST table, or `FormLinkHit::key` is empty because resolution threw (0xFF). It is checked on the raw value because `resolve_plugin_link` (source:src/formid.cpp) deliberately resolves an out-of-range index to the current plugin, so the key alone looks valid. It is a warning, not an error: official masters ship such links and the game reads them as the owning plugin's.
- `unresolved_link` / `deleted_target`: checked against the winning version of every record in the load order (last plugin wins), not against the referencing plugin's own masters.
- `wrong_target_type`: only when `slot_targets` matches a generated field (record + subrecord + offset) or a non-nested list (per-subrecord at offset 0, packed arrays at 4-byte steps, as `formlink_lists.cpp:packed_element_count`). Wildcard lists and nested lists are skipped. `CheckFinding::offset` is `FormLinkHit::offset` (`fo4/schema/form_links.hpp`), the byte offset inside the subrecord.
- `CheckOptions::plugins` limits which plugins' records are checked; the winner index still covers the whole load order.

## src/graph/check_errors.cpp:find_leveled_list_cycles

Ported from `PluginEditTool/native/src/plugin/RadiclePluginLeveled.cpp:RadiclePluginBackend::checkCircularLeveledLists` and extended to LVSP. Edges are each leveled record's FormLinks in its winning plugin; non-leveled targets are ignored. A cycle is reported once, keyed by its rotation starting at the smallest FormKey, and the returned path repeats its first node at the end.

## src/c_api_check.cpp:radicle_env_check_errors

Rows are tab-separated so the existing `radicle_free_string_array` contract covers ownership. An empty subrecord column means the finding is record-level (preflight, cycle). Adding this export moved `RADICLE_ABI_VERSION` to 3.

## src/schema/non_formid_slots.cpp:corpus_non_formid_slot

`formid_subrecords.inc` is a signature-only union of xEdit's FO4 form ID signatures, so a signature that is a form ID in one record type was treated as one everywhere (DIAL `PNAM` priority float, DIAL `SNAM` subtype code, SNDR `CNAM`, PACK `CNAM`, NPC_ `NAM4`, ...). #365: `remap_plugin_masters` rewrote those bytes whenever the master list changed. The deny list (`include/fo4/schema/non_formid_slots.inc`) is generated by `tools/corpus/non_formid_slots.py` from two sources that must agree: an official master stores a value at that (record, subrecord) whose master index is past the file's MAST table, AND xEdit `wbDefinitionsFO4.pas` (`dev-4.1.6`) declares that subrecord in that record only as scalar data (`wbFloat`/`wbInteger`/`wbString`/RGBA, a struct with no `wbFormID`, or a helper such as `wbMNAMFurnitureMarker` with no `wbFormID`). Past-table values alone are not enough: vanilla holds real links past the table (`DLCRobot.esm` REFR `XRFG`, see `GARDEN-TOOLS.md` on `resolve_plugin_link`), which the game reads as the owning plugin's, so `remap_raw` keeps remapping them. PACK `CNAM` is mixed in xEdit (record-level `Combat Style` form ID, and the `Data Input Values` union of bool/int/float after an `ANAM` type string), so `corpus_non_formid_slot` denies only a PACK `CNAM` whose previous subrecord is `ANAM`. SCEN `TNAM`/`HTID` depend on the scene action (`scene_action_scalar`): an action opens with a 2-byte `ANAM` type and closes with the empty `ANAM` marker. Inside an action `TNAM` is the Timer float and `HTID` is the Dialogue headtracking actor-ID array (or the empty Start Scene marker), so both stay scalar; only `HTID` in a Radio action (type 6, `Play Sound` SNDR) and the record-level `TNAM` (`Template Scene`, after the actions) are form IDs. It only removes slots from the generic branch of `form_links.cpp:visit_link_offsets`; record-specific handlers (WTHR, QUST, NAVM, structured slots) are unchanged. Regenerate it after adding new handlers or when new official files ship.

## src/plugin/maintenance.cpp:find_identical_to_master

Walks every group, nested ones included, bottom-up like xEdit `xeMainForm.pas:mniNavRemoveIdenticalToMasterClick` (`dev-4.1.6`): a record is reported only when it is identical to the previous version in load order AND its owned child group (`owned_child_group`: the world, cell or topic children group directly after it) would be emptied, so children are reported before their parent. An identical CELL with a changed REFR is therefore not reported, because removing it would orphan the cell's children. Injected records are not special-cased. `remove_records` erases the reported keys anywhere in the tree and drops only the groups that this call emptied.

## src/graph/plugin_diff.cpp:diff_plugins

`changed_subrecords` holds each differing signature once, sorted. Payloads are first compared per signature in order. When that finds nothing but the ordered subrecord sequence still differs (a pure reorder across signatures), `add_reordered` trims the common prefix and suffix and reports every signature left in either window. The TES4 header is a record here, so master or HEDR changes show up as a changed `TES4`.
