# Radicle code notes

## src/schema/form_links.cpp:visit_link_offsets

Record-aware classification precedes generic signature-only handling for the current copy work.

## src/schema/form_links.cpp:visit_coed_formids

`COED` is classified before the structured-slot table: owner at offset 0 always, offset 4 only when the owner record in the plugin being remapped is `NPC_`. Faction ranks are never FormIDs. Strict remap fails closed when owner type cannot be determined and the union dword is nonzero.

## src/schema/form_links.cpp:visit_coed_formids

Owner and union dwords are read before `fn(0)` because `remap_raw` rewrites offset 0 into the destination encoding; typing must use the pre-remap bytes with the old context.

## src/schema/vmad.cpp:inspect_quest_vmad

QUST extras after the primary scripts: bind byte, fragment count, optional fragment script, then fragments `{u16 Stage, u16 unused, i32 StageIndex, u8, wstring, wstring}`, then alias extras `{object, i16 version, i16 objFormat, scripts}`. Object format 2 stores unused u16, alias i16, FormID. Rewrite patches alias i16 (format 2 only) and Stage u16. StageIndex bytes are preserved.

## src/forms/quest_vmad.cpp:sync_quest_vmad_stages

xEdit FO4/TES5 name the fragment i32 `Quest Stage Index`; Mutagen `QuestScriptFragment.StageIndex`; UESP VMAD names that slot `logentry`. xEdit PERK uses a separate `Fragment Index` for chronological fragment numbers; QUST chronological ids live in `FragmentName` (`Fragment_N`). Stage u16 is xEdit `Quest Stage` / UESP `fragment.index` = QUST INDX. StageIndex is not range-checked against QSDT count. INDX remap is identity, else a unique stage-body match excluding INDX; array position is never identity. Format-1 alias objects fail closed on rewrite.

## src/forms/quest_alias_edit.cpp:write_quest_aliases

Whole-array replace copies the plugin, rewrites VMAD alias object IDs against the planned alias set, then splices aliases. Duplicate/malformed/trailing/unsupported VMAD throws before commit.

## src/forms/quest_stages.cpp:write_quest_stages

Whole-array replace remaps fragment Stage by INDX identity or unique body match, then splices. StageIndex and unrelated VMAD bytes stay identical.

## src/forms/placed_reference_copy.cpp:copy_info_as_new

The contained copy validates its ancestry on a working copy before committing changes.

## form_links.cpp :: visit_link_offsets (WTHR)

WTHR reuses FormID signatures for floats (VNAM/WNAM), bitfields (NAM1), opaque LNAM, color/speed arrays, and mixed SNAM/UNAM payloads. Remap only proven FormLink slots from WTHR_FORMID_SLOTS.md before the global signature table; otherwise float 1.0 (0x3F800000) becomes master index 63.

## src/graph/check_errors.cpp:check_load_order

Whole-load-order "Check for Errors" (#359, xEdit parity). Findings come only from slots Radicle can already prove: `collect_form_links` hits, the generated FormLink field/list target tables, `schema::preflight_plugin`, and the leveled-list graph. Unknown subrecords are never scanned, so a clean result means "no proven problem", not "no problem".

- `invalid_master_index` (warning): `FormLinkHit::key` is empty because resolution failed. A raw index past the MAST table is not an error by itself: `resolve_plugin_link` (source:src/formid.cpp) maps it to the owning plugin, as the game does, and official masters ship such links (#365, `DLCRobot.esm` REFR `XRFG`). Those links are checked like any other link, so they are only reported when the owning plugin has no such record (`unresolved_link`).
- `0xFFFFFFFF` is xEdit's None (`TwbFormID.IsNone`): `collect_form_links` leaves its key empty and the checker skips it like a null link.
- Engine-hardcoded forms: a missing target owned by `Fallout4.esm` (named explicitly, not the first plugin in the load order) with an object ID below `0x800` is skipped, matching xEdit `wbInterface.pas:TwbFormID.IsHardcoded` (`dev-4.1.6`, `_FormID < $800`). The game creates those forms itself (for example `000014`, `000007`), so `Fallout4.esm` has no records for them.
- `unresolved_link` / `deleted_target`: checked against the winning version of every record in the load order (last plugin wins), not against the referencing plugin's own masters. An unresolved link is an error only when `slot_targets` proves the slot (a generated field or list descriptor). Slots found only through the signature-union table (`formid_subrecords.inc`) are reported as warnings, because xEdit declares some of them mixed (TERM `RNAM`/`WNAM`, INNR `WNAM`, MGEF `DNAM`, ...) and their scalar values do not resolve. With that rule vanilla `Fallout4.esm` has no error-level findings (`CheckErrors.VanillaMasterHasNoErrorFindings`).
- `wrong_target_type`: only when `slot_targets` matches a generated field (record + subrecord + offset) or a non-nested list (per-subrecord at offset 0, packed arrays at 4-byte steps, as `formlink_lists.cpp:packed_element_count`). Wildcard lists and nested lists are skipped. `CheckFinding::offset` is `FormLinkHit::offset` (`fo4/schema/form_links.hpp`), the byte offset inside the subrecord.
- `CheckOptions::plugins` limits which plugins' records are checked; the winner index still covers the whole load order.

## src/graph/check_errors.cpp:find_leveled_list_cycles

Ported from `PluginEditTool/native/src/plugin/RadiclePluginLeveled.cpp:RadiclePluginBackend::checkCircularLeveledLists` and extended to LVSP. Edges are each leveled record's FormLinks in its winning plugin; non-leveled targets are ignored. A cycle is reported once, keyed by its rotation starting at the smallest FormKey, and the returned path repeats its first node at the end.

## src/c_api_check.cpp:radicle_env_check_errors

Rows are tab-separated so the existing `radicle_free_string_array` contract covers ownership. An empty subrecord column means the finding is record-level (preflight, cycle). Adding this export moved `RADICLE_ABI_VERSION` to 3.

## src/schema/non_formid_slots.cpp:corpus_non_formid_slot

`formid_subrecords.inc` is a signature-only union of xEdit's FO4 form ID signatures, so a signature that is a form ID in one record type was treated as one everywhere (DIAL `PNAM` priority float, DIAL `SNAM` subtype code, SNDR `CNAM`, PACK `CNAM`, NPC_ `NAM4`, ...). #365: `remap_plugin_masters` rewrote those bytes whenever the master list changed. The deny list (`include/fo4/schema/non_formid_slots.inc`) is generated by `tools/corpus/non_formid_slots.py` from two sources that must agree: an official master stores a non-null value at that (record, subrecord) that resolves to no record in the official load order (its master index is past the file's MAST table, or the target does not exist), AND xEdit `wbDefinitionsFO4.pas` (`dev-4.1.6`) declares that subrecord in that record only as scalar data (`wbFloat`/`wbInteger`, the string types including `wbLStringKC` localized string IDs, the RGBA and colour helpers, a struct with no `wbFormID`, or a helper whose whole right-hand side, recursively, has no `wbFormID`/`wbUnion`; `wbPTRN := wbFormIDCk(...)` and the `wbVMAD*` helpers are therefore form IDs). In-table values matter as much as past-table ones: SCEN `WNAM` editor width 350 is `0x0000015E`, index 0, and was rewritten to `0x0100015E` when master 0 moved (`RemapNonFormIdSlots.InTableScalarsSurviveMasterReorder`). Localized string IDs are the same case: TERM `WNAM` welcome text ID `0x0000ABCD` became `0x0100ABCD` (`RemapNonFormIdSlots.LocalizedStringIdsSurviveMasterReorder`). `wbUnknown` slots count as scalar too, because xEdit never remaps bytes it has not decoded (TACT `PNAM`, PACK `BNAM`). Helpers are also read from `wbDefinitionsCommon.pas` (optional fifth generator argument), and a helper is judged by the element that declares the subrecord, not as a whole: `wbWorldLODData` holds NAM3 (water form ID) and NAM4 (`LOD Water Height` float), so only WRLD `NAM4` is denied. `remap_raw` and `rekey_form_links` also leave `0xFFFFFFFF` alone: it is xEdit's None value (`wbInterface.pas:TwbFormID.IsNone`), stored in vanilla EQUP `ANAM`, and was rewritten to `0x01FFFFFF` (`RemapNonFormIdSlots.NoneSentinelAndUndecodedSlotsSurviveMasterReorder`). The corpus evidence alone is not enough either: vanilla holds real links past the table (`DLCRobot.esm` REFR `XRFG`, see `GARDEN-TOOLS.md` on `resolve_plugin_link`), which the game reads as the owning plugin's, so `remap_raw` keeps remapping them. PACK `CNAM` is mixed in xEdit (record-level `Combat Style` form ID, and the `Data Input Values` union of bool/int/float after an `ANAM` type string), so `corpus_non_formid_slot` denies only a PACK `CNAM` whose previous subrecord is `ANAM`. SCEN `TNAM`/`HTID` depend on the scene action (`scene_action_scalar`): an action opens with a 2-byte `ANAM` type and closes with the empty `ANAM` marker. Inside an action `TNAM` is the Timer float and `HTID` is the Dialogue headtracking actor-ID array (or the empty Start Scene marker), so both stay scalar; only `HTID` in a Radio action (type 6, `Play Sound` SNDR) and the record-level `TNAM` (`Template Scene`, after the actions) are form IDs. It only removes slots from the generic branch of `form_links.cpp:visit_link_offsets`; record-specific handlers (WTHR, QUST, NAVM, structured slots) are unchanged. Regenerate it after adding new handlers or when new official files ship.
## src/plugin/maintenance.cpp:find_identical_to_master

Walks every group, nested ones included, bottom-up like xEdit `xeMainForm.pas:mniNavRemoveIdenticalToMasterClick` (`dev-4.1.6`): a record is reported only when it is identical to the previous version in load order AND its owned child group (`owned_child_group`: the world, cell or topic children group directly after it) would be emptied, so children are reported before their parent. An identical CELL with a changed REFR is therefore not reported, because removing it would orphan the cell's children. Injected records are not special-cased. A record is never ITM when its placement differs from the previous version (`record_placements`): moving a REFR to another CELL or an INFO to another DIAL is a real edit even when the bytes are identical. `remove_records` erases the reported keys anywhere in the tree and drops only the groups that this call emptied.

## src/graph/plugin_diff.cpp:diff_plugins

`changed_subrecords` holds each differing signature once, sorted. Payloads are first compared per signature in order. When that finds nothing but the ordered subrecord sequence still differs (a pure reorder across signatures), `add_reordered` trims the common prefix and suffix and reports every signature left in either window. The TES4 header is a record here, so master or HEDR changes show up as a changed `TES4`. `placement_changed` marks a record whose placement differs (`record_placements`), so a REFR moved between cells with identical bytes is reported as changed.

## src/c_api_maintenance.cpp:radicle_env_identical_to_master

#360 C ABI for the maintenance APIs, in its own header (`include/fo4/c_api_maintenance.h`) because `c_api_env.h` is near the line limit. `radicle_env_identical_to_master` passes the load order up to and including the plugin to `find_identical_to_master`; rows are `record	signature	previous`. `radicle_env_deleted_counts` wraps `count_deleted_records`. `radicle_env_unused_masters` lists masters missing from `used_masters`; when `scan_master_usage` is incomplete `used_masters` keeps every master, so the list is empty and `out_complete` is 0. `bindings/csharp/tools/generate_interop.py` reads the header and the layout probe now includes every header after `c_api_env.h`. ABI stays 3: these exports ship in the same unreleased version as `radicle_env_check_errors`.

## tools/inspect/main.cpp:print_udr

`fo4inspect udr` lists deleted placed references (the records xEdit's Undelete and Disable References would fix) plus the deleted-record and deleted-navmesh counts from `count_deleted_records`.

## src/plugin/placement.cpp:record_placements

A record's placement is its parent record (resolved from the label of the enclosing world, cell or topic children group, as `environment.cpp:Environment::index_group` does) plus the type of the group that directly holds it (persistent, temporary, visible-when-distant, topic children, top level). Labels are resolved in each plugin's own master context, so the same parent compares equal across plugins with different master lists.
